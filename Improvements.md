**IMPROVEMENTS**	

**Number 1**

**Current**: User can explore others' pet profiles on Pets details page (coming from Home tab, Explore tab or Reels tab) including gender, name and age but it is difficult to see the whole main images on the top of the details page. 

**Requested**: Create an option after user taps on image, it expands.

**Reason**: Whole images are displayed in the middle of the page, without being partially cut off by the information about the pet and the top of the page. User can see images more clearly.



**Number 2**

**Current**: User can select and go through Map on the Explore tab and can't take a look at the working hours and contact information of vet stations. 

**Requested**: Include working hours and a phone number, from where user can directly activate the call, below rating information.

**Reason**: The important information is visible to user, without going to Google to search for additional information by station name. It is simplified and user does not have to exit the application.



**Number 3**

**Current**: User can select the Unfollow option on Profile page from section Following and it is hard to return back that user, to follow again.

**Requested**: Create a confirmation box which will appear when user initiates removing users from Following list. Confirmation box “Are you sure?“ has 2 options:
